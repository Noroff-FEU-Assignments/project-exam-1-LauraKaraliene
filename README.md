"Awesome Peaks" is a blog all about my hiking adventures across Norway. I share stories, pictures, and memories from my treks through different trails and climbs, exploring all the beautiful spots I find along the way.

## Description

For my first-year exam, I had to create and develop a blog site from scratch. I could pick the design and topics but needed to stick to some requirements to show what I learned during the year:

- Made a design prototype first
- Built the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- The home page has a 'Latest Posts' section with a carousel
- TThe blog posts page shows the first 10 blogs and has a button to click and see more posts
- Used modal images
- Made sure the contact form works right with JavaScript validation
- Used an API from a WordPress installation
- Did user testing with a Hotjar installation

## Built With

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript)
- [WordPress API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)
