            <h1>WHO AM I?</h1>
            <p>I am Laura, 
                mountain lover and nature explorer. 
                Accompanied by my boyfriend Patrick and our fluffy
                friend Bachi, we wander in the wilderness of mostly Norway,
                collecting unforgettable experience. 
                Here I want to share my best moments with you and inspire 
                other explorers to follow my steps. </p>

            <h1>DISCOVER NATURE'S BEAUTY TOGETHER !</h1>
            <p>Every post I share has a uniq description with guidance and tips for 
                those who want to visit that place. 
                I’m not trying to invent a bike here.  Same as many other hikers, I get inspiration from other travel blogs, hiking and weather forecast apps. That’s how I prepare and know what to expect.  So I truly recommend to do your own research and enjoy every minute without any unexpectedness.  </p>

            <h1>TIPS & TRICKS</h1>
            <p>Invest in good waterproof mountain shoes and test them before longer foot-tour. Bleeding heels or swollen toes have never been a good company for a traveler. 
                Choose your backpack size wisely. You may need enough space for clothes and food even if it’s just a few hours walk. 
                Weather conditions can drastically change, so dress up in layers. Sunscreen and cap - my most reliable companions in summer!
